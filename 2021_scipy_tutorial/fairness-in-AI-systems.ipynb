In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of assessing and mitigating fairness-related harms in the context of the U.S. health care system. This tutorial will consist of a mix of instructional content and hands-on demonstrations using Jupyter notebooks. Participants will use the Fairlearn library to assess ML models for performance disparities across different racial groups and mitigate those disparities using a variety of algorithmic techniques."

Most health systems use these programs as the cornerstone of population health management efforts, and they are widely considered effective at improving outcomes and satisfaction while reducing costs.
