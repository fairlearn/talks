In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of assessing and mitigating fairness-related harms in the context of the U.S. health care system. This tutorial will consist of a mix of instructional content and hands-on demonstrations using Jupyter notebooks. Participants will use the Fairlearn library to assess ML models for performance disparities across different racial groups and mitigate those disparities using a variety of algorithmic techniques."
